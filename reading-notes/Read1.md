### What are the different types of versions control?

1. __Local version Control:__ entails one database on one hard disk to store changes to files.

2. __Centralized Version Control:__ in this system many programmers can work on a file or set of files , and the system entials a single srever storing all changes to files.

3. __Distributed Version Control:__ unlike CVC, DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories which will prevent data loss if server goes down by creating backups.

## Advatages:

* *__Snapshots__*

Each time we save a changed version of the project Git creats a reference to it called **snapshot**.

* *__Local Operations__*

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. and this makes us able to work even when we are offline.

* *__Tracking Changes__*

Git always track ever change which makes it able to prevent any corruption or loss of information.

* *__Loss of Data__*

Git can reduce loss of data to the minimum range.

* *__States__* 

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
