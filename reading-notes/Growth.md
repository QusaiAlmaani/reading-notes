**_3 Advice to get a growth mindset_**

1.__ Allow yourself to dream__
##### Every new adventure or achievement begins with a dream. Let yourself dream and donâ€™t place any limitations on your dreams. Your dreams are part of your creative self: if you embrace them, you will identify new opportunities for growth. Now try them out.

2. __Acknowledge and embrace imperfections__
##### Hiding from your weaknesses is a sure fire way to guarantee you will never overcome them. It will also hamper your attempts to develop a growth mindset. If you embrace your imperfections you can break their power over your mindset and succeed in spite of them.

3. __Try one new thing every day__

##### If you commit to trying one new thing every day, by the end of the year you will have tried 365 new things. The chances of finding something you like, enjoy or are good at are much higher. More importantly, you will soon develop a personal growth mindset where you see challenges rather than problems, and are unafraid to try new things.
