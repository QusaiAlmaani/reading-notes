## What is Expression ?

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

### there are two types of expressions:

1. _ **Primary expressions** _

*Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.*

2. _ **Left-hand-side expressions** _

*Left values are the destination of an assignment.*

## operators

- **Assignment operators**
 *An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. *

- **Comparison operators**

*A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.*

- **Arithmetic operators** 

 *An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. *

- **Bitwise operators**

*A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.*

- **Logical operators**

*Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.*

- **String operators**
*In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.*

- **Conditional (ternary) operator**

*The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.*

- **Comma operator**

*The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop.*

- **Unary operators**

*A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.*

- **Relational operators**

*A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.*

- **Operator precedence**

*The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. *

## Control Flow

*The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.*
